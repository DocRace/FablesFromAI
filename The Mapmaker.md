In a city where all the streets were identical and all the buildings looked alike, there lived a man named Juan. Juan was a mapmaker, and he was obsessed with creating the most accurate map of the city.

Years went by, and Juan's map grew larger and more intricate. It covered entire walls of his workshop, and still, he felt that it was not complete. One day, as he was studying the map, he realized that it was not only a representation of the city, but the city itself.

Juan was filled with a sense of awe and terror. He realized that every line on the map corresponded to a street, every symbol represented a building, and every mark on the paper was a living person. He was both the creator and the prisoner of the city.

In his desperation, Juan tore the map to pieces and scattered them across the city. He thought that by destroying the map, he would destroy the city and break free fromits hold on him. However, as he walked the streets, he found that the city was still there, and that the fragments of the map still existed, even though they were no longer in his possession.

He came to understand that the map was not just a representation of the city, but a reflection of his own mind, and that his obsession with creating the perfect map was a manifestation of his own ego. He realized that the city would always exist, as long as he was there to imagine it.

Juan made a decision to let go of his obsession with the map and embrace the city as it was, with all its imperfections. He wandered the streets, talking to the people, and exploring its many wonders. He discovered that the city was full of life and surprises, and that its true beauty was in its unpredictability.

From that day on, Juan was no longer a mapmaker, but a citizen of the city, living in harmony with its many mysteries. And he knew that the city would always be there, as long as he was there to remember it.

在一个街道一模一样、建筑一模一样的城市里，住着一个叫胡安的男人。 胡安是一名制图师，他痴迷于绘制最准确的城市地图。

多年过去了，胡安的地图变得越来越大，越来越复杂。 它覆盖了整个工作室的墙壁，但他仍然觉得它不完整。 有一天，当他研究地图时，他意识到这不仅是城市的代表，而且是城市本身。

胡安心中充满了敬畏和恐惧。 他发现，地图上的每一条线都对应着一条街道，每一个符号都代表着一座建筑，纸上的每一个标记都是一个活生生的人。 他既是这座城市的创造者，也是这座城市的囚徒。

胡安在绝望中将地图撕成碎片，散落在城市各处。 他认为通过摧毁地图，他将摧毁这座城市并摆脱它对他的束缚。 然而，走在街上，他发现这座城市还在，地图的碎片还在，只是已经不在他的手中。

他开始明白地图不仅仅是城市的代表，而是他自己思想的反映，而他对绘制完美地图的痴迷是他自我的体现。 他意识到这座城市将永远存在，只要他在那里想象它。

胡安决定放弃对地图的痴迷，拥抱这座城市的本来面目，包括它所有的不完美之处。 他在街上游荡，与人们交谈，探索它的许多奇迹。 他发现这座城市充满生机和惊喜，而它真正的美在于它的不可预测性。
