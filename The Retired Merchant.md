# The Retired Merchant

Prompts: Write an original short story, with some background of Chinese book: the Book of Changes

Once upon a time, in ancient China, there lived a wise scholar named Chen. Chen was well-versed in the ways of the world and was especially knowledgeable about the teachings of the Book of Changes.

One day, Chen was approached by a wealthy merchant who sought his counsel. The merchant was at a crossroads in his life, torn between two paths: to continue building his wealth or to retire and enjoy his riches.

Chen listened to the merchant's dilemma and then, using the principles of the Book of Changes, he cast the merchant's future. To the merchant's surprise, the reading showed that both paths led to success, but in different ways.

The merchant was confused. How could both paths lead to success? Chen explained that the Book of Changes teaches that the future is not set in stone, but is shaped by the choices one makes. The merchant's future would be determined by the path he chose to take.

The merchant left Chen's presence, deeply contemplating his options. He soon realized that the true measure of success was not in the material wealth he had acquired, but in the happiness and fulfillment he experienced in life.

And so, the merchant chose to retire and spend his remaining days surrounded by his loved ones, basking in the joys of life. He lived a long and fulfilling life, never regretting his decision to choose the path of happiness over wealth.

Chen's wisdom and the teachings of the Book of Changes had once again shown that the greatest wealth one can attain is the wealth of the soul.  


## 🇨🇳 - 退休的商人
Translated by Google Translator.

从前，在中国古代，有一位名叫陈的聪明学者。 陈深谙世事，尤精通易经。

一天，一位富商找到陈，向他请教。 这位商人正处于人生的十字路口，在两条道路之间左右为难：是继续积累财富，还是退休享受财富。

陈听了商人的困境，然后用易经的原理，铸造了商人的未来。 出乎商人意料的是，读数显示两条道路都通向成功，但方式不同。

商人很困惑。 两条路如何通向成功？ 陈解释说，易经教导说，未来不是一成不变的，而是取决于一个人所做的选择。 商人的未来将取决于他选择的道路。

商人离开陈的存在，深深地考虑他的选择。 他很快意识到，真正衡量成功的标准不是他所获得的物质财富，而是他在生活中所体验到的幸福和满足。

于是，商人选择退休，在亲人的陪伴下度过余生，享受人生的乐趣。 他过着漫长而充实的生活，从不后悔选择幸福而不是财富的道路。

陈氏的智慧和易经的教导，再一次证明了人所能获得的最大财富是心灵的财富。
