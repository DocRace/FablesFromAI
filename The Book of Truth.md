Prompts: In the style of Jorge Luis Borges, write a short story


Once upon a time, in a vast library, there lived a man named Jorge. He spent his days wandering the endless shelves, devouring the countless books that filled the rooms. He was searching for something, a truth that had eluded him for years.

One day, as he was perusing a particularly ancient tome, he came across a reference to a book that was said to contain all the knowledge of the universe. Intrigued, he set out to find this book.

Jorge searched high and low, in libraries near and far, but the book was nowhere to be found. He began to despair, thinking that he would never find what he was looking for.

And then, one day, as he was about to give up, he received a mysterious message. The sender told him that the book was waiting for him, in a place where time stood still and the labyrinths never ended.

Without hesitation, Jorge set out on the journey, facing countless dangers and hardships along the way. He finally reached the place where the book was said to be kept, a chamber at the heart of a labyrinth.

As he stepped into the chamber, he saw the book, its pages shimmering with a soft light. And as he reached out to take it, he realized that the book was not a physical object, but a reflection of his own mind. The knowledge he sought was not to be found in any book, but within himself all along.

From that day on, Jorge continued to wander the library, but he did so with a sense of peace and understanding, for he knew that he carried the universe's knowledge within him always.

从前，在一个巨大的图书馆里，住着一个名叫豪尔赫的人。 他整天在没完没了的书架上徘徊，吞噬着满屋子的无数书籍。 他在寻找某种东西，一个他多年来一直未能找到的真相。

有一天，他在阅读一本特别古老的书籍时，偶然发现了一本据说包含宇宙所有知识的书。 出于好奇，他开始寻找这本书。

豪尔赫四处寻找，在远近的图书馆里四处寻找，但找不到这本书。 他开始绝望，认为他永远找不到他要找的东西。

然后，有一天，就在他快要放弃的时候，他收到了一条神秘的信息。 寄件人告诉他，这本书正等着他，在一个时间静止、迷宫永无止境的地方。

豪尔赫毫不犹豫地踏上了征途，一路上面临着无数的危险和艰辛。 他终于到达了据说存放这本书的地方，一个位于迷宫中心的房间。

当他走进房间时，他看到了那本书，书页闪烁着柔和的光芒。 当他伸手去拿它时，他意识到这本书不是实物，而是他自己思想的反映。 他所寻求的知识不是在任何书本上都能找到的，而是一直在他自己的内心深处。

从那天起，豪尔赫继续在图书馆里闲逛，但他怀着平静和理解的心情这样做，因为他知道他始终怀揣着宇宙的知识。
