Prompts: Write a parable to help people deal with nihilism

Once upon a time, there was a farmer who lived in a small village. One day, while tending to his fields, the farmer heard a voice whisper in his ear, "Everything you do is meaningless. Your life has no purpose, and all your efforts will eventually be forgotten."

The farmer was troubled by the voice, and he began to believe that everything he did was indeed meaningless. He stopped tending to his fields, stopped caring for his animals, and stopped enjoying life. He became consumed by nihilism and felt as though nothing mattered anymore.

One day, a wise old sage came to the village and met the farmer. The sage asked the farmer why he was so troubled, and the farmer told him about the voice that had whispered in his ear. The sage listened carefully and then told the farmer a parable.

"Imagine," the sage said, "that you are a single drop of water in a vast ocean. Alone, your drop of water seems small and insignificant. But as you join with other drops, you become part of a powerful current that can shape the world. Just like that drop of water, your actions may seem small and insignificant, but when combined with the actions of others, they can make a significant impact on the world."

The farmer thought about the sage's words, and he realized that he had been wrong. His actions, no matter how small, still had meaning and could make a difference in the world. He returned to his fields and resumed tending to them, caring for his animals, and enjoying life once again.

The farmer's life was once again filled with purpose and meaning, and he learned that even in a world that may seem meaningless, one's actions can still have a profound impact on others. And so, the farmer lived a life filled with purpose and joy, inspiring others in the village to do the same.

The moral of this parable is that even in a world that may seem meaningless, we can still find purpose and meaning by making a difference in the lives of others. Our actions, no matter how small, can still have a profound impact on the world and shape it for the better.


## 🇨🇳 - 虚无主义的农民
Translated by Google Translator.

从前，有一个农民住在一个小村庄里。 一天，农夫在耕种田地时，听到一个声音在他耳边低语：“你所做的一切都是没有意义的。你的生活没有目的，你所有的努力最终都会被遗忘。”

农夫被这个声音困扰了，他开始相信自己所做的一切确实毫无意义。 他不再照料他的田地，不再照顾他的动物，也不再享受生活。 他被虚无主义所吞噬，觉得一切都不再重要了。

一天，一位睿智的老圣人来到村里，遇到了农夫。 圣人问农夫为什么如此烦恼，农夫告诉了他耳边低语的事。 圣人仔细听了，然后给农夫讲了一个比喻。

“想象一下，”圣人说，“你是浩瀚海洋中的一滴水。单独一滴，你的水滴似乎微不足道。但当你与其他水滴汇合时，你就会成为一股强大的水流的一部分，这股水流可以 塑造世界。就像那一滴水，你的行为看似微不足道，但与他人的行为相结合，就会对世界产生重大影响。”

农夫想了想圣人的话，他意识到自己错了。 他的行为，无论多小，仍然有意义，可以改变世界。 他回到自己的田地，继续照料它们，照顾他的动物，再次享受生活。

农民的生活再次充满了目的和意义，他了解到即使在一个看似毫无意义的世界中，一个人的行为仍然会对他人产生深远的影响。 因此，这位农民过着充满目标和快乐的生活，并激励村里的其他人也这样做。

这个寓言的寓意是，即使在一个看似毫无意义的世界中，我们仍然可以通过改变他人的生活来找到目的和意义。 我们的行动，无论多小，仍然可以对世界产生深远的影响，并使它变得更美好。
